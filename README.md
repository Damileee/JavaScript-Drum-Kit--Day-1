Key Features:
- Keyboard event listener: Listens for keydown events to trigger sound effects.
- Audio playback: Plays corresponding sound files based on the pressed key.
- Visual transition effect: Adds a transition effect to the pressed key using CSS classes.

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Press keys on the keyboard to trigger sound effects and see the visual transition effect on the corresponding keys.
